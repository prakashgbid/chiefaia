Okay, I'm ready to start the step-by-step replacement of the `README.md` content.

**Step 1: Clear Existing Content**

I will try to remove all the content in the `README.md` file.

```
print(default_api.natural_language_write_file(language = "markdown", path = "README.md", prompt = "Replace the entire content of the file with nothing, making the file empty."))
```
