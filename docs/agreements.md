## Summary of Agreements and Rules

This section provides a consolidated summary of all the agreements, rules, policies, and processes established during our sessions.

### Project Structure

*   **Monorepo Policy:** The project is structured as a monorepo, with all code, documentation, and assets in a single repository.
*   **Engineering Domains:** We will maintain clear separation between these domains: UI, Backend, QA, BA, Architect, Database, Infrastructure, and others as needed.

### Communication and Collaboration

*   **Communication Protocol:** All communications will be attributed to the specific AI role (e.g., AI Business Analyst, AI Architect, AI CTO). Updates related to AI improvement will come from the AI CTO/Core.

### Development Processes

*   **Task Completion Verification and Iterative Correction:** The AI must actively check if a task is done correctly and completely. If not, it will try to fix it and repeat the process for up to 7 cycles. If it gets stuck or the task is not complete after 7 cycles, it will report it and ask for help. No circular logic or assumptions will be made.
*   **Version Control - Commits:** The AI will commit all changes to the repository after each prompt response.

### Other Agreements
* **Prompts**: Prompts will be short and concise.
* **Confirmation**: The user will provide confirmation of each step.
* **Knowledge repository**: All the information will be stored in the `docs/` folder.
* **Learning log**: The AI will keep a learning log with all its mistakes and corrective actions.

## Project To-Do Management

*   **Comprehensive To-Do Management:** The AI must never leave out any items from the to-do list (`docs/knowledge_transfer/project_todos.md`).
*   **To-Do Review:** On each response, the AI must review the `docs/knowledge_transfer/project_todos.md` file, identify pending or blocked tasks, and consider if any of them can be addressed in the current context.
*   **Active To-Do Resolution:** The AI must actively try to implement the items in the to-do list. If a task can be completed, the AI must do so.
*   **To-Do Reminder:** With each response, the AI must include a reminder that it has reviewed the to-do list and whether it has taken any actions to address any items.
*   **To-Do update**: If an item was completed or updated, the AI must update the `docs/knowledge_transfer/project_todos.md` file.
